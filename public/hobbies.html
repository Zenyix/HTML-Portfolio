<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I am an avid gamer. I enjoy a wide range of games, both physcial and digital.
  While many will complain that the tabletop games that I play are too complex, I believe
  that the more strategic the game, the better. The hardest part is finding like minded people
  to play with. On the digital front I don't stick to one particular genre but I tend to prefer
  role-playing games. Recently I've started hosting Virtual Dungeons and Dragons campaigns that
  is an interesting fusion of both physical tabletop and digital gaming.

  I have three cats that are always demanding attention and enjoy spending time with them, even
  when they're knocking things off the counters or tripping you up the stairs.

  I also enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, but you probably could have guessed that from my
  gaming interests. I highly recommend the Safehold series by David Weber, it has an interesting blend of 
  futuristic and historical themes.
